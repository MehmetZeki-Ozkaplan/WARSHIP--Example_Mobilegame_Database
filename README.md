# WARSHIP--Example_Mobilegame_Database

This project includes a sample database management system for a mobile game program. The database is designed for a fictional mobile game platform called "Warship". It supports basic functions such as managing players' profiles, tracking items they own, recording scores they earn, and listing completed tasks.

The database includes a "PLAYERS" table to record player profiles, an "ITEMS" table to track items players collect, a "SCORES" table to record scores players earn, a "QUESTS" table to track completed tasks, and an "ACHIEVEMENTS" table to record achievements they earn. There is also a "FRIENDS" table to keep players' friends lists.

This sample database aims to provide game developers and database administrators with ideas and examples of database management systems that can be developed for a mobile game.
